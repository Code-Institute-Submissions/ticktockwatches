### Design


##### Framework

  * Bootstrap 4
  * jQuery 3.4.1
    * In an effort to keep the JavaScript minimal, I have decided to use jQuery as foundation to my scripts framework.
  * Django 1.11
    * Django is a free and open-source web framework that I've used to render the back-end Python with the front-end Bootstrap. We were taught how to use Django 1.11 in the lessons, despite Django 2.0 being the current version,I used Django 1.11

#### Color Scheme


#### Icons

* Font Awsome 5.11.2

    I prefer to use Font Awesome icons for this project, as they have significantly more icons to use. 

#### Typography

#### Wireframes
